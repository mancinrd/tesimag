\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
Plasma medicine is an emerging field that is broadening its applications from uses on medical equipments (sterilization, decontamination) to uses on living tissues (\cite{plmed_review}). One of the reserch groups working in RFX laboratories, in Padova, developed a source for the production of Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) to be used for medical treatment on biological tissues: Plasma Coagulation Controller (PCC) (\cite{DeMasi_2018}). The source is a DBD reactor, where a dielectric is used to produce plasma with low charge density. It is developed to specializes in non thermal blood coagulation, i.e. acceleration of blood clot formation thanks to plasma direct application.

During this work we analyze prototypes alredy built, develop a new model and study how the source produces and expels plasma, with electrical measurements (chapter \ref{ch:electric}), high speed image acquisition (chapter \ref{ch:shape}), plasma emission spectrum analysis (chapter \ref{ch:spectrometry}) and temperature measurements (chapter \ref{ch:temperature}).


\section{Cold Atmospheric Plasma}
Cold atmospheric plasma is plasma at atmospheric pressure without thermodynamical equilibrium between electron and ions, where electronic temperature is higher then ion temperature (\cite{VONENGEL196599}). In those conditions we can treat plasma dynamics as the collective motion of two interpenetrating fluids, where the thermal motion of ions can be ignored (\cite{goossens2012introduction}).
There are several studies on CAP plasma characteristics (\cite{Zhu_2009}, \cite{Ohyama_2009}, \cite{Amorim_2015}) common values are electron temperatures $T_e = 1 - \SI{10}{\electronvolt}$ and electron densities $n_e = \num{e17} - \SI{e22}{\meter^{-3}}$ , inside the box outlined in figure \ref{fig:plasmaclass}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Plasma generation: RF and DBD}
Electron density in CAPs is a small fraction of the neutral number density of an ideal gas $n_{n} = \SI{2.50e25}{\meter^{-3}}$, but higher then the number of electron-ion pair generated by radioactive substances and cosmic rays, ionization rate of $\SI{e7}{\meter^{-3}\second^{-1}}$ (\cite{book:1593058}).
If we apply a steady electric field to a gas, electrons from atoms or molecules are extracted via direct ionization due to the electric field and via collisions with accelerated electrons. Those electrons can ionize other molecules giving birth to chain reactions that sustain plasma discharge. This process depends on gas species, their ionization potential and cross section of different reactions, on characteristics lenght of the system that influences electron's acceleration, and on gas pressure, because it is proportional to reaction rates.
%The breakdown conditions are defined by the well known Paschen curves, where the voltage breakdown potential is studyed for different values of the product of electrodes distance and gas pressure, related respectively to electron acceleration and collisions frequency.
Generally electrons acquire more energy from the electric field due to the lower mass and higher mobility, so electronic temperature increases more rapidly then ion temperature. If we apply a steady DC electric fields, electrons and ions reach thermal equilibrium trough collisions, generating thermal plasma at high temperatures. To produce cold plasma at high densities, is possible to give energy only to electrons with AC electric fields at high frequency or pulsed electric fields (\cite{BARDOS20106705}).

CAPs are of particular interest in plasma medicine for two characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
 \item it is \textbf{Cold} : given non thermal equilibrium and ion low temperature, this plasma can be applied on surfaces without a dangerous increase in target temperature. In plasma medicine CAPs allow treatment on living tissues, where target temperature must stay below a safe value.
 \item it contains many \textbf{Reactive species} : if we produce plasma at atmospheric pressure, we can easily mix the gas used for plasma discharge with air. The peculiarity of a plasma in air is the presence of reactive species, ions, produced by ionization and recombination of nitrogen, oxygen, water and other atoms or molecules. There are several biological processes where activation and reactions speed is thought to be related to concentration of Reactive Oxydant Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) (\cite{doi:10.1152/ajplung.2000.279.6.L1005}, \cite{doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00366.2006}). 
\end{itemize}

Two examples of sources developed for medical use are the ones built at RFX: the RF source based on a radio transmitter (\cite{Martines_2009}) and the DBD source, studied in this work (\cite{DeMasi_2018}).

\paragraph{RF source}
The RF source developed in RFX is composed by two coaxial tubes, the internal one is connected to a radio transmitter in series with a matching network and with an electrode formed by a wire grid, the external one ends with a second electrode fixed at ground potential, as in figure \ref{fig:RF}. The radio transmitter works with fixed power (\SI{5}{\watt}) and is set to a specific frequency that is the resonance frequency for the LC series circuit formed by the induttance in the matching network and the parasitic capacitance of the device. When neutral gas flows inside the inner tube, the electric field between the electrode ionizes it, producing cold plasma in air. The source is built with an induttance of \SI{100}{\micro\henry}, capacitance is estimated as \SI{10}{\pico\farad}, resulting in a resonance for a frequency around \SI{4.8}{\mega\hertz}, reaching voltage peak to peak values of \SI{900}{\volt} on the electrode. Regolation on the gas flow allows to start the discharge more easily and to reach different peak voltage values.
This source produces plasma directly in air, so it ionizes a mixture of neutral gas and air, giving birth to plasma rich in reactive species coming from oxygen and nitrogen molecules. The presence of reactive species allows to use this source for non-thermal sterilization of living tissues, as is shown that this plasma has bactericidal effect without damaging human cells (\cite{doi:10.1002/ppap.200700154}, \cite{Stoffels_2007}).

\end{figure}


\paragraph{DBD source}
The source developed in this work is based on the Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD): an electric field is applyed on the gas using one electrode or a pair of electrodes, where a dielectric covers at least one of them, as in figure \ref{fig:DBDex}.
The dielectric works as an insulator and doesn't allows DC current to flow in the gap, so the gas between the electrodes can be ionized without large current densities flowing trough the resulting plasma (\cite{Kogelschatz2003}). The discharge can be modelized as in the circuit in figure \ref{fig:DBDex} (b) (\cite{DBDcircuit}), $C_1$ is capacitance of dielectric, $C_2$ of air and $R_p$ and $C_p$ are plasma resistance and capacitance. From this simple model we can have an idea of the profiles of voltage and current in plasma, while in other studies we can find more refined models (\cite{doi:10.1063/1.4986023}). Typical values for discharge parameters are repetition pulse rates $\ge \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}$ and voltage peak from \num{1} to \SI{20}{\kilo\volt}, with current intensities $<\SI{100}{\milli\ampere}$.

\end{figure}

DBD plasma reactors changed in the last decades following the development of pulse power technology: from the classic sinusoidal voltage now is common to apply pulsed voltage. Plasma generated with sub-microseconds voltage pulses allows to avoid local discharges overheat and to increase the discharge efficiency enanching production of reactive species inside the plasma (\cite{SHAO2009215}). Those progresses in DBD plasma technology led to the development of sources for biomedical plasma applications.

Those plasma sources, including PCC, have to produce plasma rich in reactive species, while meeting stringent requirements such as low temperature (at or near room temperature), no risk of arcing, operation at atmospheric pressure, preferably hand-held operation, low concentration of ozone generation, etc.
The typical design that respects those requirements is in figure \ref{fig:DBDmed} (\cite{Stoffels_2006}, \cite{doi:10.1063/1.2045549}): a cylindrical electrode is covered in dielectric material and inserted in a tube with neutral gas flowing in it. The gas, helium or argon, allows to start plasma discharge, then plasma is expelled in air where it produces reactive species needed for medical treatment.

\end{figure}

PCC developed in this thesis is built with a similar design that will be described in details in chapter \ref{ch:electric}, along with its electrical characterization. 

An intersting phenomenon of sources with this design is plasma formation and propagation. High speed camera measuraments of the process showed that plasma is not produced in a uniform steady column, but every pulse of the electric field gives start to localized plasma emission that moves away from the electode and propagates in air, with velocities from \num{10} to \SI{150}{\kilo\meter/\second}. Those localized plasma emissions are called ``bullet'' and only recently we can find models to describe them \cite{Lu2016DynamicsOA}. We observe and study this phenomenon in details in chapter \ref{ch:shape}, changing voltage pulse parameters, target position and gas composition.

To know plasma composition a typical approach is emission spectrometry, we present our measurements in chapter \ref{ch:spectrometry}.
Plasma produced by our source can be applied on human skin without danger, an estimation of power deposition on the target is presented in chapter \ref{ch:temperature}.
